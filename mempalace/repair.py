"""
repair.py — Scan, prune corrupt entries, and rebuild HNSW index
================================================================

When ChromaDB's HNSW index accumulates duplicate entries (from repeated
add() calls with the same ID), link_lists.bin can grow unbounded —
terabytes on large palaces — eventually causing segfaults.

This module provides four operations:

  status  — compare sqlite vs HNSW element counts (read-only health check)
  scan    — find every corrupt/unfetchable ID in the palace
  prune   — delete only the corrupt IDs (surgical)
  rebuild — extract all drawers, delete the collection, recreate with
            correct HNSW settings, and upsert everything back

The rebuild backs up ONLY chroma.sqlite3 (the source of truth), not the
full palace directory — so it works even when link_lists.bin is bloated.

Usage (standalone):
    python -m mempalace.repair status
    python -m mempalace.repair scan [--wing X]
    python -m mempalace.repair prune --confirm
    python -m mempalace.repair rebuild

Usage (from CLI):
    mempalace repair
    mempalace repair-scan [--wing X]
    mempalace repair-prune --confirm
