# HNSW tuning to prevent link_lists.bin bloat on large mines (#344).
#
# With default params (batch_size=100, sync_threshold=1000, initial capacity
# 1000), inserting tens of thousands of drawers triggers ~30 index resizes
# and hundreds of persistDirty() calls. persistDirty uses relative seek
# positioning in link_lists.bin; accumulated seek drift across resize cycles
# causes the OS to extend the sparse file with zero-filled regions, each
# cycle compounding the next. Result: link_lists.bin grows into hundreds of
# GB sparse, after which `status`/`search`/`repair` segfault.
#
# Setting large batch and sync thresholds at collection creation defers
# persistence until a single large batch completes, breaking the resize+
# persist feedback loop. Empirically validated on a 39,792-drawer rebuild
# (palace 376 MB, link_lists.bin 0 bytes, no segfault) in 2026-04.
#
# Note: chromadb 1.5.x exposes a `collection.modify(configuration={"hnsw":
# {"batch_size": ..., "sync_threshold": ...}})` retrofit path for already-
# created collections (`UpdateHNSWConfiguration` in chromadb's API), but
# this PR doesn't pursue that — once link_lists.bin has bloated, the index
# is already corrupt and the only known recovery is a fresh mine.

    Sniff-tests the chromadb-written segment metadata file
    (``index_metadata.pickle``) for its expected format bytes without
    parsing it. ChromaDB writes that file after a successful HNSW flush;
    a complete write starts with byte ``0x80`` and ends with byte
    ``0x2e`` (the protocol/terminator byte sequence chromadb serializes
    with). If both bytes are present and the file is non-trivially sized,
    chromadb will load the segment cleanly even when its on-disk mtime
    trails ``chroma.sqlite3`` — which is the *steady state* under
    chromadb 1.5.x's async batched flush, not corruption.

    A missing metadata file is treated as "fresh / never-flushed" and
    considered healthy. Renaming an empty dir orphans nothing, and a
    real corruption case manifests as a present-but-malformed file or a
    chromadb load error caught downstream by palace-daemon's
    ``_auto_repair`` retry path.

    Deliberately format-sniffs only; never deserializes. Deserialization
    can execute arbitrary code, and the byte-sniff is sufficient to
    distinguish a complete write from truncation, zero-fill, or
    partial-flush corruption.

    Assumes pickle protocol >= 2 (``0x80`` PROTO marker). Matches what
    chromadb writes today; if a future chromadb version emits protocol
    0/1 segments, this check would start returning False on healthy

    """Rename HNSW segment dirs that are both stale-by-mtime AND fail an
    integrity sniff-test.

    Catches the segfault failure mode from #823 (semantic search stale
    after ``add_drawer``), observed at neo-cortex-mcp#2 (SIGSEGV on
    ``count()`` with chromadb 1.5.5), and acknowledged as by-design at
    chroma-core/chroma#2594. Renaming a corrupt segment lets chromadb
    rebuild lazily on next open instead of segfaulting.

    Two-stage check:

    1. **mtime gate.** If ``chroma.sqlite3`` is less than
       ``stale_seconds`` newer than the segment's ``data_level0.bin``,
       skip — chromadb is in normal write-path territory.

    2. **Integrity gate** (``_segment_appears_healthy``). Even when the
       mtime gap exceeds the threshold, a segment whose
       ``index_metadata.pickle`` passes a format sniff-test is healthy:
       chromadb 1.5.x flushes HNSW state asynchronously and a clean
       shutdown does NOT force-flush, so the on-disk HNSW is *always*
       somewhat older than ``chroma.sqlite3``. Production observation
       (2026-04-26 disks daemon): three of three segments quarantined
       on every cold start, with 538-557s gaps, leaving the 151K-drawer
       palace with vector_ranked=0 until rebuild. Renaming a healthy
       segment based on mtime alone destroys a valid index — chromadb
       creates an empty replacement, orphaning every drawer in sqlite
       from vector recall until the operator runs ``mempalace repair
       --mode rebuild`` (15+ min on a 151K palace).

    Only segments that pass stage 1 (suspiciously stale) AND fail stage
    2 (metadata file truncated, zero-filled, or absent-with-data) are
    renamed to ``<uuid>.drift-<timestamp>``. The original directory is
    renamed, not deleted, so recovery remains possible if the heuristic
    misfires.

    The default threshold (5 min) is advisory under daemon-strict; the
    integrity gate is what actually distinguishes corruption from flush
    lag. The threshold still matters for the cross-machine replication
    case (#823), where it bounds how stale a Syncthing-replicated
    segment can be before we look harder at it.

    Args:
        palace_path: path to the palace directory containing ``chroma.sqlite3``
        stale_seconds: minimum mtime gap to *consider* a segment for quarantine

    Returns:

    ChromaDB 0.6.x stored seq_id as big-endian 8-byte BLOBs. ChromaDB 1.5.x
    expects INTEGER. The auto-migration doesn't convert existing rows, causing
    the Rust compactor to crash with "mismatched types; Rust type u64 (as SQL
    type INTEGER) is not compatible with SQL type BLOB".

    Scoped to the ``embeddings`` table only. The ``max_seq_id`` table used
    to be included in this loop, but chromadb 1.5.x writes its own BLOB
    format there (``b'\\x11\\x11'`` + 6 ASCII digits). Misinterpreting that
    format via ``int.from_bytes(..., 'big')`` yields a ~1.23e18 integer
    that silently suppresses every subsequent write for the affected
    segment (``embeddings_queue`` filters on ``seq_id > start``). chromadb
    owns the ``max_seq_id`` column — we leave it alone. Palaces already
    poisoned by the old behaviour can be repaired via
    ``mempalace repair --mode max-seq-id``.

    Defense-in-depth: rows with the sysdb-10 ``b'\\x11\\x11'`` prefix in
    ``embeddings`` are skipped rather than converted. Real 0.6.x BLOBs are
    pure big-endian u64 with no text prefix, so the prefix check is a
    no-op for genuine legacy data.

    Must run BEFORE PersistentClient is created (the compactor fires on init).

    Opening a Python sqlite3 connection against a ChromaDB 1.5.x WAL-mode
    database leaves state that segfaults the next PersistentClient call. After
    the migration has run once successfully, a marker file is written so
    subsequent opens skip the sqlite connection entirely. Already-migrated
    palaces can touch the marker manually to opt into the fast path.

    # Per-process record of palaces that have already had quarantine_stale_hnsw
    # invoked at least once. The proactive drift check is a *cold-start*
    # protection — it catches HNSW segments that arrived stale relative to
    # ``chroma.sqlite3`` (e.g. cross-machine replication, partial restore,
    # crashed-mid-write). Once a long-running process has opened the palace
    # cleanly, re-firing on every reconnect is a *runtime thrash*: the
    # daemon's own writes bump sqlite mtime but HNSW flushes batch on
    # chromadb's internal cadence, so the mtime gap naturally exceeds the
    # threshold under steady write load even though nothing is corrupt.
    # Real runtime drift is still handled — palace-daemon's ``_auto_repair``
    # calls :func:`quarantine_stale_hnsw` directly on observed HNSW errors,
    # which bypasses this gate.
    #
    # Thread-safety: this set is mutated without a lock. Two concurrent
    # ``make_client()`` calls for the same palace can both pass the
    # membership check and both invoke ``quarantine_stale_hnsw``. That's
    # safe because the function is idempotent (mtime check + timestamped
    # rename of distinct directories), so the worst-case race produces
    # one redundant rename attempt that no-ops. Idempotency is the
    # safety property; locking would add cost without correctness gain.
